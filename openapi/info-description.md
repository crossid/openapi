# Introduction

Crossid API allows you to manage resources in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.

All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the Crossid UI is also available through this API,
allowing you to code actions that suites your requirements.

The rest of this page provides a general overview about the API design and technology that has been implemented.

## OpenAPI Specification

Crossid API conforms the OpenAPI V3 specification.

The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which

allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
of the service without access to source

code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can

understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
implementation logic. Similar to what

interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
guesswork in calling the service.
